# A PyTorch implementation of a YOLO v3 Object Detector



```

### On Video
For this, you should run the file, video_demo.py with --video flag specifying the video file. The video file should be in .avi format
since openCV only accepts OpenCV as the input format. 

```
python video_demo.py --video video.avi
```

Tweakable settings can be seen with -h flag. 

### Speeding up Video Inference

To speed video inference, you can try using the video_demo_half.py file instead which does all the inference with 16-bit half 
precision floats instead of 32-bit float. I haven't seen big improvements, but I attribute that to having an older card 
(Tesla K80, Kepler arch). If you have one of cards with fast float16 support, try it out, and if possible, benchmark it. 

### On a Camera
Same as video module, but you don't have to specify the video file since feed will be taken from your camera. To be precise, 
feed will be taken from what the OpenCV, recognises as camera 0. The default image resolution is 160 here, though you can change it with `reso` flag.
